# BadgerBook
Made a website using an api from my school to gather students from a cs class and put their profiles in this website called the 'Badger Book'. Worked with html, css and js to display and create interactive features for the profiles.
Worked explicitely with the app.js file to be able to get data from the API provided, I worked with making a infinite scroll grid layout for the profiles as well as making the search button interactable to case-insensitive, and substring inputs. As well as updating the count in the top to how many students match the desired search result.
